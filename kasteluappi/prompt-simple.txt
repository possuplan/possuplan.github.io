Make single page html/javascript mobile app with dark mode theme where you can mark when you have watered your plants. The data is saved to browser memory using database, so it persists even when browser is closed.

On top left is icon of 3 lines that opens menu that has options: Plants and Calendar, which open a page when clicked.

Plants page lists all plants you have, and allows adding new plants or editing existing plants. The list is as compact as possible: all buttons and inputs for one plant must fit on one row.

The plants list row has:

plant name input (which you can edit on the fly),  

delete button (with confirmation prompt), 

icon that allows reordering the plants in the list.

In the very last row is empty inputs to add new plant information, and under that is "add plant" button.

Calendar page lists all plants as a table data with dates, where first column is date (use title for the column as "pvm") and next columns are plant names. the plant name text is rendered 90 degrees rotated left, so it doesnt take much horizontal space. So, first cell in each row of data is the date (dd.mm.yy format), then for each column there is clickable button that switches between two colors: default is black, active (means plant had been watered) is dark blue. so if you double click it once from black state, it turns to blue state, and when you double click the blue state, it turns back to black state. The button is not styled and fills the whole cell and must be double tapped to change state. the plant name column width should be fixed at 40px. the date column should be fixed width to fit the date, lets say 70px. and the newly changed states should display light blue background to show that it was changed on that session. if page is closed and reopened, those light blue backgrounds show as dark blue again.

The table has gray borders between cells, and the last date is on top (which is always the current date), so below that are dates in the past. The table is initialized for first run in that way it saves empty values for current date, so the history of waterings starts from the date when the app was first used.

when you have defined any plants and reopen the page, it will show the calendar page by default. when not any plants defined, then it displays plants page.

The calendar page is scrollable horizontally and vertically.
